************* TODO:
ASAP:
- fix mobile text content being cut off
- fix mobile horizontal overflow issue
- add in the Video
- Swiper instead of Carousel for overhang
- favicon GR logo.

LATER:
- Get rid of warnings
- fluid type / font size
- Setup dotenv to init serverside so that we have ability to load private env vars securely to serverless endpoints, and still be ommited from the client bundle
- Setup Vite plugin or Svelte preprocessor to use optmized/compressed images.
- Factor out API keys and Mailgun config to into secure env vars.
- Add in css nano and other prod only optimizations
- if we are using any custom fonts, preload them
- See if we can figure out how to deploy to Lambda@edge + cloudfront/s3 via a custom BB pipeline
- Reveal animations for the sexy polish
- Consider using Segment server side in order to store contact form data in one of our DBs.
- Path Trace logo animation on initial visit.
- Run a Lighthouse, make sure we are doing everything in our power to optimize
- make the circle of icons at the bottom of the page real buttons that work
- make the circle of icons at bottom of page have a cool reveal animation
- look at switching out our static backgrounds with WebGL/Canvas based animations.
- Use svelte-kit auto import plugin to cleanupo and reduce code
- move dependencies to dev dependencies, since the compiled version of this app has no prod specific dependencies
- optimize how it looks on huge screens (4k, ultrawide, etc)
- consolidate icons into single dir with indexed export
